[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=Jacksondr5_startup-company-helper&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=Jacksondr5_startup-company-helper)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and as such has all the scripts you'd expect.

# Motivations

- Create a companion to a favorite game of mine, [Startup Company](https://store.steampowered.com/app/606800/Startup_Company/), to help me find ways to optimize my company
- Practice [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Stop starting side projects (at least 5 in flight when I started this) and start finishing them. (That's my excuse for the **rough** edges in this one)

I'll probably have to port it into Electron at some point to make it more useful, but doing that initially would have violated the 3rd motivation.
